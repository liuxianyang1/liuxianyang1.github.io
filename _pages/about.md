I am currently a Research Assistant at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), working on **LLM reasoning and data synthesis**, advised by Prof. [Jiaheng Wei](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/jiahengwei). Previously, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at Ant Group, where I focused on **Multi-agent Systems for LLM/VLM applications**, contributing to the open-source project (*[MuAgent](https://github.com/codefuse-ai/CodeFuse-muAgent/tree/main)*). I received Master of Science degree (Applied Statistical Modelling & Health Informatics) from King’s College London, conducted in Prof. [Richard Dobson](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/richard-dobson)’s research group and B.S. degree (Computer Science) from Coventry University.

My research interests focus on developing intelligent reasoning systems with large models and exploring their real-world applications:

- **LLM/VLM Reasoning**  
  - **Agent Planning:** enhancing the planning ability of large models in industry scenarios (*[MuAgent](https://github.com/codefuse-ai/CodeFuse-muAgent/tree/main)*).  
  - **LLM Reasoning:** reducing reliance on costly human-labeled data by generating high-quality synthetic reasoning data to improve model reasoning ability (*AgenticMath*, Submitted to ICLR 2026, will release paper and code soon).  
  - **Tool Use:** enabling agents to interact with web interfaces and external tools to solve complex tasks (*WebAgent*).  

- **AI for Healthcare**  
  - **Multimodal Reasoning:** integrating textual and visual modalities for improved clinical decision support.  
  - **Medical RAG:** addressing the limitations of smaller language models in **biomedical entity linking** (Master’s dissertation).
