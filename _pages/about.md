I am currently a Research Assistant at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), working on **LLM reasoning and data synthesis**, advised by Prof. [Jiaheng Wei](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/jiahengwei). Previously, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/en), where I focused on **Multi-agent Systems for LLM/VLM applications**, contributing to the open-source project ([MuAgent](https://github.com/codefuse-ai/CodeFuse-muAgent/tree/main)). I received Master of Science degree (Applied Statistical Modelling & Health Informatics) from King’s College London and B.S. degree (Computer Science) from Coventry University.

My research interests focus on developing intelligent reasoning systems with large models and exploring their real-world applications:

- **LLM/VLM Reasoning**  
  - **Agent Planning:** enhancing the planning ability of large models in business scenarios ([MuAgent](https://github.com/codefuse-ai/CodeFuse-muAgent/tree/main)).  
  - **Post-training & Reasoning:** reducing reliance on costly human-labeled data by generating high-quality synthetic reasoning data to improve model reasoning ability ([AgenticMath](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19361#)).  
  - **Web Agent:** enabling agents to interact with web interfaces and external tools to solve complex user's tasks (WebAgent project in ANT group).  

- **AI for Healthcare**  
  - **Multimodal Reasoning:** integrating textual and visual modalities for improved clinical decision support.  
  - **Medical RAG:** addressing the limitations of smaller language models in Biomedical Entity Linking (Master’s dissertation).
