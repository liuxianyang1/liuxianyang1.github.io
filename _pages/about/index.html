Previously, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at Ant Group, where I focused on <strong>Multi-agent Systems for LLM/VLM applications</strong>, contributing to the open-source project <em><a href="https://github.com/codefuse-ai/CodeFuse-muAgent/tree/main" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MuAgent</a></em>. I received Master of Science degree (Applied Statistical Modelling &amp; Health Informatics) from King’s College London and B.S. degree (Computer Science) from Coventry University.</p> <p>My research interests focus on developing intelligent reasoning systems with large models and exploring their real-world applications:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>LLM/VLM Reasoning</strong> <ul> <li> <strong>Agent Planning:</strong> enhancing the planning ability of large models in industry scenarios (<em><a href="https://github.com/codefuse-ai/CodeFuse-muAgent/tree/main" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MuAgent</a></em>).</li> <li> <strong>LLM Reasoning:</strong> reducing reliance on costly human-labeled data by generating high-quality synthetic reasoning data to improve model reasoning ability (<em>AgenticMath</em>, under submission to ICLR 2026).</li> <li> <strong>Tool Use:</strong> enabling agents to interact with web interfaces and external tools to solve complex tasks (<em>WebAgent</em>).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>AI for Healthcare</strong> <ul> <li> <strong>Multimodal Reasoning:</strong> integrating textual and visual modalities for improved clinical decision support.</li> <li> <strong>Medical RAG:</strong> addressing the limitations of smaller language models in <strong>biomedical entity linking</strong> (Master’s dissertation).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </body></html>
